# Wasim Akram

**Principal Data & AI Engineer @ [VML MAP (WPP)](https://www.vml.com/)** · **P1 Affiliated Researcher @ [AI Centre Denmark](https://www.aicentre.dk/)** · Copenhagen 🇩🇰

I build production-grade **agentic AI systems** and resilient **data/ML platforms**, while studying how **sparsity and modularity** emerge in dense language models—and how to turn that structure into real efficiency wins.

Right now I'm working through [Antikythera's *What Is Intelligence?*](https://whatisintelligence.antikythera.org/) curriculum and replicating Anthropic's interpretability studies to stay grounded before pushing the frontier.

- 🔬 Current project: **Scaling Specialization in Dense LMs** (sparsity & modularity vs. model size; dynamic-k inference)
- 🧠 Focus: sparse autoencoders (SAEs), mechanistic interpretability, scaling laws, evaluation/reliability
- 🛠️ Stack: Python, HF/Transformers, Snowflake/BigQuery, GCP/AWS, dbt, Spark/Glue, Vertex/Cloud Run, CI/CD, cost/perf
